# Some project where I mess with Haskell

I used [this tutorial](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours) which honestly isn't that beginner-friendly or explicitly Haskell-centric. But I did find it to hit a lot of functional coding points I missed coming from imperative style, notably the common mechanism of transforming foreach and condition-terminated loops into expressions.

## Setup

### Shell tools

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

Install the Haskell Stack:

```bash
brew install haskell-stack
```

### Visual tools

Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Launch it.

Type ⇧⌘P to bring up the command palette, then type to run `Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH`.

Quit VS Code.

Use `code mess-with-haskell.code-workspace` to open the project. Install recommended extensions.
